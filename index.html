                <h2>An Excerpt From Dracula</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>I went on with my part of the work, and in another 
                        half hour had found the name and address of 
                        Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to him. 
                        All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit 
                        directions regarding the place of burial were given. 
                        I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, 
                        Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:--</p>

                    <p>"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, 
                        my service is to you."</p>
                    
                    <p>"Have you got what you looked for?" I asked, to which 
                        he replied:--</p>
                    
                    <p>"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped 
                        to find, and find I have, all that there was--only 
                        some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. 
                        But I have them here, and we shall for the present say 
                        nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow 
                        evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some."</p>
                    
                    <p>When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--</p>
                    
                    <p>"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want 
                        sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow 
                        we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there 
                        is no need of us. Alas!"</p>
                    
                    <p>Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The 
                        undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the 
                        room was turned into a small chapelle ardente. There 
                        was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death 
                        was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of 
                        the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the 
                        Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we 
                        both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax 
                        candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. 
                        All Lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death, 
                        and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces
                        of "decay's effacing fingers," had but restored the beauty 
                        of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that 
                        I was looking at a corpse.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved 
                        her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his 
                        eyes. He said to me: "Remain till I return," and left 
                        the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic 
                        from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been 
                        opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and 
                        around the bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his 
                        collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the 
                        mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we came 
                        away.</p>
                    
                    <p>I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory 
                        tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to 
                        speak:--</p>
